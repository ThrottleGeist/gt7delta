# GT7 WR Coach Dave Delta Files

This repository stores **World Record telemetry files** recorded from **Gran Turismo 7** replays using Coach Dave Delta. The purpose is to provide a reference archive of top-level lap data for analysis, comparison, and learning.

## Contents
- 📂 `deltas/` — Recorded WR Delta files from GT7 replays
- 📝 `README.md` — Project overview

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Import the desired `.delta` file into your **Coach Dave Delta app**.
3. Load alongside your own laps to compare telemetry and improve performance.

## Notes
- Not every file is guaranteed to be the *absolute* world record:  
  - If a new record was set very late, it may be missing.  
  - If the fastest driver did not share their replay, it cannot be recorded.  
- The objective is to capture the **fastest lap available with a shared replay**.
